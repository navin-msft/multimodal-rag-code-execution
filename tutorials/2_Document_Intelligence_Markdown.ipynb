If there are, you **MUST** follow the Chain of Thought below:\\n    1. Locate every Markdown table in the text using the provided Table Edges, and write down the number of those tables in your scratchpad.\\n    2. Work on every two consecutive Markdown tables in a pairwise manner. For every pair of consecutive Markdown tables, you **MUST** check if they have any text between them. If the two tables are immediately consecutive, but there is text between them and this text is a footnote or a page number, you can safely ignore it, and mark the two tables as consecutive in your scratchpad. If, however, there is valid text between the two tables, then you **MUST** mark the two tables as not consecutive in your scratchpad.\\n    3. Write down the number of checks you have to perform. You will have to perform checks for consecutive tables pair-wise.\\n\\n After completing the above steps, you **MUST** then do the following for every two immediately consecutive Markdown table:\\n    A. If the separated Markdown tables are immediately consecutive, then check the headers and the data type of the columns of each table to estimate if the two tables originated from the same table but got split into two because of the page break, or because of the OCR extraction process.\\n    B. If you find that these two Markdown tables likely belong to the same original table, then output **EXACTLY** the full last row of the first table, and the first full row of the first table in Markdown table format. Also output the exact string of characters that exist between the two tables in the JSON output.\\n    C. Repeat the above steps for **ALL** immediately consecutive Markdown tables located in your scratchpad, to match the number of checks in your scratchpad.\\n\\n**SUPER IMPORTANT**: We define a Markdown table by having consecutive rows with no space between, with the each row separated from the next by \\'|\\n\\'. Do not separate Markdown table semantically. \\n\\n\\nJSON OUTPUT FORMAT:\\nRemember that you **MUST** process every two immediately consecutive or consecutive Markdown tables.
